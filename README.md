    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Configuration

This project uses a hardcoded API key for the OMDb API in `src/App.tsx`.

```typescript
// src/App.tsx
const res = await fetch(
  `https://www.omdbapi.com/?s=${query}&apikey=e76f4147`
);
```

For personal or production use, it is recommended to obtain your own free API key from the [OMDb API website](https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx) and replace the existing one.
